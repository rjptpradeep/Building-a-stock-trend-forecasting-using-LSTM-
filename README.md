# Building-a-stock-trend-forecasting-using-LSTM-
Stock market is one of the major fields that investors are dedicated to, thus stock market price trend prediction is always a hot topic  from both financial and technical domains. In this project, my objective is to build a model with lower RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) value and best fitted graph to predict future price trend with lower risk of loss and good results.

	In this project we will be looking at data from the Indian stock market. We will learn how to use pandas to get stock information and visualize different aspects of it. we will be predicting future stock price through a Long Short Term Memory(LSTM) method.
